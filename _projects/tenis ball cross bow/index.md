title: Design and Construction of a Tennis Ball Crossbow (Gr. 12 Physics Project)
description: Worked in a team to create a tennis ball launcher capable of hitting precise distances (5, 10, and 15 meters). We began by researching existing launcher designs and brainstorming solutions. After evaluating several ideas, we chose a crossbow-style mechanism for its stability and repeatability. I translated our rough sketches into a CAD model using Fusion360. We then used the drawings to help construct the launcher from wood. We tested the device to determine the optimal launch angles and draw lengths for each target. On test day, the final build successfully hit the 5m and 15m targets and got close to the 10m target.
skills: 
- Teamwork and Collaboration
- Brainstorming and Design Research
- CAD Design (Fusion360)
- Prototyping and Fabrication
