title: Evaluating the efficiency of a generic cartesian tree sorting algorithm (Gr. 12 Computer Science project)
description: Designed and implemented a project to assess the efficiency a generic Cartesian Tree sorting algorithm using Python. Created scripts to generate best, average, and worst-case input datasets, then timed the algorithmâ€™s performance on each. Automated collection and export of data to a spreadsheet for analysis using openxl library. Drew conclusions based on the data collected and the effect of input order on sorting speed. Algorithm code was sourced online, but data recording, and analysis code was written independently.
skills: 
- Python Programming
- openxl library
